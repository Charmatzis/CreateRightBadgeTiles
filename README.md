Create Right Badge Tiles icons for Universal Windows 10 Mobile apps

This is a Console app solution for the error in Universal Windows 10 Mobile apps where the Badge Tile icons return this king of error:   "The image {something} has an ABGR value "{something}" at position ({somewhere},{somewhere}) that is not valid. The pixel must be white (##FFFFFF) or transparent (00######)."
 
Please, enjoy it!!!!!
